# Longitudinal Analysis of Mental Distress

The repository is built to present the longitudinal analysis of mental distress and the effectiveness of intervention for the purpose o staitstical consulting. The study investigates changes in subjects’ mental distress over time in an intervention group and a control group. Mental distress in subjects were measured at baseline (month=0), 3, 6, 18, and 60 months, based on their answers to questionnaires.   

The main objectives of the study are to compare the treatment effect on reducing mental distress (GSI) compared with the control group, to study how subjects’ mental distresses change over time, and to investigate whether the changes in mental distress over time can be partially explained by the treatment and other variables (e.g., gender and education).


After necessary data wriangling, exploratory data analysis, mixed-effect modeling and generlized linear modeling will be conducted to investigate the statistical modeling above.
